Creating a RESTful API for a To-Do List application involves several steps, including setting up the server, defining the data model, and implementing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Below is a basic outline of how to create a To-Do List RESTful API using Node.js and Express, along with a simple in-memory data store.

**Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**
Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
Create a new directory for your project

mkdir todo-api
cd todo-api

Initialize a new Node.js project:

npm init -y

Install Express:

npm install express

Step 2: Create the API
Create a new file named server.js:

Step 3: Run the API
Start the server:

Test the API: You can use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints.

Step 4: API Endpoints
Here are the endpoints you can use:

Create a Task: POST /tasks

Request Body: { "title": "Task Title" }
Read All Tasks: GET /tasks

Read a Single Task: GET /tasks/:id

Update a Task: PUT /tasks/:id

Request Body: { "title": "Updated Title", "completed": true }
Delete a Task: DELETE /tasks/:id

Step 5: Additional Considerations
Data Persistence: The above implementation uses an in-memory array to store tasks. For a production application, consider using a database (like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) for data persistence.
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling for better user experience.
Validation: Use libraries like Joi or express-validator to validate incoming data.
Authentication: If needed, implement user authentication to manage tasks per user.

This basic setup should give you a good starting point for building a To-Do List RESTful API. You can expand upon it by adding features like user authentication, task categories, due dates, etc.
